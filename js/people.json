    "story": "I moved to Roorkee back in 1992, when I was very young and you were not even born. Before that I used to wash dishes at the Hotel Delhi Continental. I worked for 7 years at the restaurant that is now called Prakash, back then it was called Savera. Then I worked for a while for your mess, the pots there used to be so big for me that I had to go into one to clean it. Now, I run this canteen and am also establishing shops in the city, I have been working hard all my life and I just want to keep moving ahead even if its slow. I still only sleep four hours a day.",
